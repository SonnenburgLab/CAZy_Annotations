Just a list of annotations for GHs and PLs. These are mostly pulled from cazypedia.org. These annotations are non-exclusive. For example, something can be annotated as animal carbohydrate degrading and HMO degrading. Feel free to add as you find new annotations. Something useful to do down the line, would be to add a reference column.
